**Pixel Graphics In Your Terminal Emulator**

## Limitations

-   Sixel drawing area is at least 30 x 6 pixels large.

-   Maximum of 256 colors per image

-   Vertical step size : 6 pixels

-   Splitting up the image into small bits to increase  
    the color palette results in heavy performance  
    cost due to shitty image handling of the terminal.
